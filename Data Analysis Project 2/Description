This data analysis project simulated questions from the Ministry of Health of Vietnam.
The data consisted of interview questions and answers from 2069 respondents.
I was interested in possible relationships between the responds and whether they had taken a medical check-up in the past year.
This analysis used an AIC step method to find the variables that best fit the Logistic Model. 
More details can be found on the PDF.
