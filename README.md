I am an aspiring data scientist, and this is my first attempt at a portfolio through GitHub.

There are largely 3 projects shown in this portfolio.

Data Analysis Project 1,

Data Analysis Project 2,

Stock Prediction Project.



The stock prediction project was a group project, but I have only included the portion that I worked on.
The datasets used for each projects are included in the folder, and a brief description attempts to summarize what was done in the projects.


I am open to all kinds of feedback, and as this is my first time using GitHub, would love to hear back from anyone.
